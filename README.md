This application is for demonstration of how to run deep learning models on the browser
using javascript and Tensorflow.js

Multiple pretrained models are included in the repository as url.

In this repository we are using Keras models.
If you wish to use your own model you can reference to [this link](https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/import-keras.html)
